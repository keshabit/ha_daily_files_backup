# HA files backup (hourly)
A simple script to back up your most important or key files or the files that need frequent changes in Home Assitant and protection from any accidental mistakes; the recovery files with ease or save you from losing your continuous improvisions and hard work. I went through it, had a hard time, and decided to put this so that basic (non-scripting) users can have a simple mechanism to protect their changing files. Of course, it's always encouraged to do a timely full backup to avoid any ultimate loss. Please go through the ReadMe.txt for more details
