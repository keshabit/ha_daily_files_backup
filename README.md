# HA files backup (daily)
A simple script to back up your most important or key files in Home Assitant and protect from any accidental issues; will also help you to recover files with ease or save you from losing your comtinous improvisions. I went through it and decided to put this so that basic (non-scripting) users can have a simple mechanism to protect their files. Of course, it's always encouraged to take a timely full backup to avoid any ultimate loss. Please go through the ReadMe.txt for more details
